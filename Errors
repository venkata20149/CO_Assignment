Some error generating cases:

1. usage of labels with the same name of variables and vice versa.
2. usage of labels with the same name as the operations (like add, sub, xor, etc.) or variables.
3. Repetition of usage of labels or variables with the same names.
4. If hlt statment is not the last instruction in the code. Even if a hlt is encountered, check if that instruction is the last in the code and if not,
   check until the end of the file to see for more hlt statements (as it's possible to have multiple hlt statements).
   "If you detect that you have an hlt instruction in the mid (you found that there are more instructions left after you encountered hlt), you can 
   stop at that point and print the error which says that hlt was found in the mid."
